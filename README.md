# ViFi

ViFi is a tool for detecting viral integration and fusion mRNA sequences from Next Generation Sequencing data.  Unlike standard approaches that use reference-based read mapping for identification of viral reads, ViFi uses both reference-based read mapping and a phylogenetic-based approach to identify viral reads.  ViFi also incorporates mappability scores of the reads to filter out false positive integration detection.  The end result is a tool that can accurately and precisely detect integrated viruses, even if the viruses are highly mutated or novel strains.

The ViFi manuscript is currently in preparation and the software will be released once it has been submitted.
